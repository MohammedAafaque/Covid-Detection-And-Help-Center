                        We need to fight the virus together. Getting vaccinated puts us a step ahead of the virus.
                        COVID-19 vaccines help in keeping you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19.
                        Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased
                        risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
